My Milestone Project 1 READ.ME

Graceful Bouquets

The first thing you need to know about my project is that it is built around an actual existing business! Graceful Bouquets
is a small business located in Tingley, Wakefeild, West-Yorkshire - WF31AT. The business was created by my girlfriend Grace
and so far is smashing it. The business is esentially a flower retailer, meaning she takes orders from customer, sometimes
these orders have specific requests on how theyd like the bouquets to look, sometimes they need personalizing for a specific 
occasion and other times the customers let grace have a blank canvas and create a new one from scratch. The products she uses
to decorate the flowers are all eco friendly. The main goal of the project is to let our potential customers that we are a unique
flower retailer, we have a wide range of products, we can facilitate weddings and thatr our products are customizable and overall that the
project gives of the vibe that the business has a geniune passion for flowers.

UX

Who is the Website for?

The website is for a small business owner who.

What is the purpose of the Website?

Prior to this website the only way the business owner advertised and showcased her products was on social media, by creating this website it 
allows the business owner to expand to a muge wider audience and gives people who are browsing the web a chance to accidentally stumble
across the site which overall would increase the sales of a business.

Goals for the Site:

1. Gain new customers
2. Expand to a wider audience
3. Options for a customer to learn more about the business
4. Options to learn more about the products in detail
5. Show what occasions the business faciliate
6. Show are best sellers

How does the site acheive these goals?

Firslty, when the user enters the site they see the home page where they see a paragraph describing the business, telling the customers
that the products are bespoke and that we can facilitate specific occasions which meats the requiremnts of goal number 5 and 4.

Secondly, the user scrolls down on the home page and they see the Best Sellers section, what this does is shows the customers that out of all
the products these 3 are the most popular which meets goal number 6. Indirectly though this shows new users that the business has enough sales
to be able to have a best seller section, which makes user more comfortable in purchasing a product because when customer see that other users
have purchased from the site they will feel that the site is actually legitimate and therefore will be more comfortable in trusting and 
purchasing from the business. 

Thirdly, on the main navigation see that there are 3 links, Home, About and Products - Lets say the user selects the about us link they will
be redirected to the about us page, where there they can learn in greater detail how the business started/where it is located. They can learn
in more detail what our products are, what the business belives in and more detail about our services. If they select the products link
they are redirected to the produt page. On the product page there are 3 pictures on 3 rows, unless on mobile it goes to 1 picture stacked 
on top of each other. From here the customers can see the products on offer. Under each product the customer will see a "VIEW" button
where when selected the same product appears, but bigger with a description of the flowers that were used to make the product, how much the
product is and what other materials were used to create that specific product. As well as that, there is a brief description on HOW to order
links to the social medias our customers purchase the product off. 


Features:

Home Page - So when a new user enters my site they see a JavaScript carousel, this looks asthetically pleasing for the users but really have
a significant impact, on each picture we i have included quotes based arround flowers, each quote is significant to what the business 
belives in and indeed how passionate the site owner is about her craft. I have included these quotes because as a consumer, when a business
is passionate about there product it shows me that they have a geniune interest in the business and that the products offered will always
be of a high standard. Then we have a price list, the reason i included the price list on the home page is so the site users can see that 
the pricing of our products are very acceptable. This is a known practice, for example look at the Rolex website, notice that a user would need
to navigate through 4 or 5 pages before they see an actual price, why is this? This is because Rolex are so expensive that if they put there
price lists on the home page the users would see £7000 - £50000 price range and already the user is thinking thats expensive. However as they 
include the information prior to the price the user can see all the features of the watch, start to like it and THEN see the price. We have the
opposite effect as our products are cheap, we show the user this so that they are already persuaded, then when they navigate through to the 
products and learn more about them. Then we have our best sellers, read the 2nd paragraph underneath "how do we acheive these goals section"
to understand why. Underneath the best sellers we have a veiw button, which when selected navigates the user to THAT specific product, rather
than the whole product page. Again there is a reason for this, firstly, why would somebody select the view button? they obviously liked
what they saw and wanted to veiw it in greater detail, so we naviagate them to that specific product page because, lets imagine we navigate
them to the whole product page, and they see another product that they like, which of course is great! However, this could mean the customer
wont purchase any of the products. The reason for this is when they select that view button, they are %100 interetsed in that product, However
if we navigate them to the product page and they see another product that they like, that %100 interest in the first product is 
halved, and therefore the chance of the customer buying a product as been halved. A real world example of this is in supermarkets, for example
have you noticed how chewing gum is mainly shown at the till? the store do this so that a customer will see the chewing gum, see a till and think
why not, its an impulse buy, whereas, a bag of harribos, they will have there own isle away from the tills, meaning the customers will pick them
up, and whilst they continue shopping, they think do i really need these? and what happens? they are dumped on a random isle, i know for a fact 
that ive done this and the chances are the people who read this will have also done that. So by skipping the product page and going straight 
to that specific product page, they see the product, they see the link to buy it and by then there mind is already made up. Then we have a how
to buy section, which is also included in the product page as it explains that, like the business the website is still growing and hopefully soon
they will be able to order on the site.

About Page - The about section is where the customers can learn more about the business, the reason why this is so important is because they 
can see that each product geniunelly is made espescially and specifically made for them, which i think adds that something special about the business
, it seperates them from the global florist businesses and it almost recognises that the customers purchase has a feeling behind it, and for 
the business to be apart of what makes that feeling into an action that has a significant impact, on those who receive the flowers. Another 
feature shown on the About page is that the materials we use are all eco friendly which in this day and age is essential. For example imagine 
there are 3 florist, all sell flowers, all of there bouquets are lovely, but only one of the shops has echo friendly products, which one florist
do you use? LUSH are a great example of this, there products are very similar to what other body lotion shops sell but there echo friendly approach
is the reason people queue outside there shops to get in. On this section are customers can also learn about our ability to facilitate events
which expands us from being a business that makes flower arrangments to a business that can make a dream wedding come true.

Product Page - Obviously, a page which showcases the products we offer, the page is is 3 rows all with 3 products on each row, all shown resposively
accross different platforms. A product is shown as such, a picture of the product, the name of the product, the price and a view option. The reason
i made a seperate page for specific products, is because on the product page, you need the customer to have an initial attraction to a product
regardless of what materials are used, once they see a product that they like they would select the view button, which would then supply the
user with the additional information to give them more persuasion into actually BUYING the product.

Testing

Firstly, i used the google chrome developer tools to test the responsiveness of my site - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/

Secondly, copy testing, most devs will know what copy testing is, copy testing is testing the content inside the site, in a real world a BA 
would supply the copy and a tester would test against - however since i was supplying the contents, i simply tested that all the words, were spelt
correctly - an easy task that makes a huge difference.

Thirdly, as my site contains alot of images, i tested that all the alt texts work and are helpful and descriptive.

Fourth, is the site accessible? i.e how easy is it for a customer navigating through the website using NVDA, the site is easy to navigate through
and i couldnt see how a visually empared user would have any issues.

Fifth, exploratory testing, i tried to break the site, which i admitt, is so hard to do on such a simple site so no issues were found - i think
exploratory testing is more for projects 3 and 4.

Burger icon on a galaxy fold populated underneath the header. Fix - Reducing the font size of the business name on max-widths 300px

Footer had white space below it. Fix - Made the body background color the same color as the footer - note that i tried other fixes such as bottom
0px but changing the color was the only thing that worked for me. This has left a a big footer on iPad that is still an exsisting bug.

Home page image didnt have margins on phone veiwpoints. Fix - Added left and right margins for 500px veiwports.
